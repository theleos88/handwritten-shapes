# handwritten-shapes
Set of vectorial handwritten shapes to make design, graphics, schemes.


![Example](./example.png?raw=true "This is an example")

![Axis](./example-exports/xy-axis.png?raw=true "This is an xy axis from an export")


## How to do it

1) One way is to directly write the pic using svf format (e.g. by using Inkscape).

2) A second way is to provide a real handwritten image (png, jpg, whatever)
- Then import in inkscape
- Trace the bitmap
- Export the path using svg format.
